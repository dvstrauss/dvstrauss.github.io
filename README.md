## Adding more content
* Add more content
* Commit any changes you want to keep
* Push to main or branch etc.

If you also want to update the github page, run `./deploy.sh`

## Explanation
The branch `gh-pages` is a git subtree of the `dist` folder, and github Settings for Pages is set to use that branch as the page content.
