## Adding more content
* Add more content
* Make pull request
* Merge to main
* Wait for github Pages to get updated

## Explanation
A github Action workflow runs on merge to main which creates a tmp branch with a generated `dist` folder and pushes it as a subtree to the `gh-pages` branch. That branch is used as the root folder for github Pages.
